How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It pointed to the location of difference and showed where did the files differ

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

one can check where he/she went wrong and can keep it as a reference, or if the older code was efficient then it can be restored.
